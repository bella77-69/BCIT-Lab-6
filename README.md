## Description

Project Instructions: 

BCIT has asked students in BCIT to design an Instagram-like photo application. 

Assume that the front-end has already been built for you, and your back end will be receiving a zip that will contain photos. 

**You need to design a Node.js application that can extract the zip file and apply filters**

**to these photos.** This assignment is all about getting comfortable working with libraries (both core to Node.js and third-party), reading documentation, writing modular code, and understanding asynchronous programming/streams within web development.

### Task:

Your task is to take a zip file containing several images, unzip it, apply a filter to each of the imageâ€™s pixel data, save it back into a new image. While this may seem like a challenging task, you will be allowed to use several specific third-party libraries that will greatly simplify the process.
